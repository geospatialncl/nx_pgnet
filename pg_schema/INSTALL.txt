INSTALL VIA "one-click" .bat

-- Standard install (requires that a pgpass.conf password file has been saved with the correct credentials at the following location):

	- ensure you run the cmd window as postgres user

	- C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\postgresql\pgpass.conf
	
	Run the following command, adjusting the 4 parameters according to your needs, to install the database tables, functions and trigger procedures to your chosen database. The following example would install the network_interdependency schema in to the "empty" database
	
	ni_setup_database.bat "localhost" "postgres" "C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\9.0\bin\" "empty"
	
	Parameters:
	
	1 - host name
	2 - user name
	3 - postgresql bin folder location
	4 - database name
	
	ni_setup_database.bat calls the following files in this order:
		
		/functions/processing/ni_setup_processing_functions.bat
		/functions/trigger/ni_setup_trigger_functions.bat
		/functions/tables/ni_setup_tables.bat
		/functions/generic/ni_setup_generic_functions.bat

INSTALL VIA RUNNING .bat(s) separately		
		
-- Alternatively, the setup .bat files can be run individually, simply by supplying the same parameters to each function as was described above in the standard install method.
	-- Each example listed below is available as a .bat file already, with the prefix "execute_ni_", and with default values for parameters defined. The parameters used can easily be adjusted to fit your individual configuration.
	
	processing functions - /FUNCTIONS/PROCESSING/ni_setup_processing_functions.bat "localhost" "postgres" "C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\9.0\bin\" "empty"

	Available from: (example_execute_ni_setup_processing_functions.bat)
	
	trigger functions - /FUNCTIONS/TRIGGER/ni_setup_trigger_functions.bat "localhost" "postgres" "C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\9.0\bin\" "empty"
	
	Available from: (example_execute_ni_setup_trigger_functions.bat)
	
	setup tables - /TABLES/ni_setup_tables.bat "localhost" "postgres" "C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\9.0\bin\" "empty"
	
	Available from: (example_execute_ni_setup_tables.bat)
	
	generic functions - /FUNCTIONS/GENERIC/ni_setup_generic_functions.bat "localhost" "postgres" "C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\9.0\bin\" "empty"
	
	Available from: (example_execute_ni_setup_generic_functions.bat)


INSTALL VIA COMBINING ALL .sql(s)
	
--Alternatively again, it is possible to merge all the individual .sql files (all tables, all functions (generic, processing, trigger) in to separate single .sql for execution on a database i.e. a ni_tables.sql file, a ni_processing_functions.sql, a ni_trigger_functions.sql, and a ni_generic_functions.sql

	--Each .bat file listed below can be executed independently from within each respective folder, OR executed together by running the file execute_ni_combine_sql_files.bat from the top level folder. Either method will create combined .sql files for the processing, trigger and generic functions, as well as the tables that make up the database.
	
	
	merge all processing functions - /FUNCTIONS/PROCESSING/ni_combine_processing_sql_functions.bat - this will generate a file called ni_processing_functions.sql based on merging all processing functions from /FUNCTIONS/PROCESSING/ folder
	
	merge all trigger functions - /FUNCTIONS/TRIGGER/ni_combine_trigger_sql_functions.bat - this will generate a file called ni_trigger_functions.sql based on merging all trigger functions from /FUNCTIONS/TRIGGER/ folder
	
	merge all generic functions - /FUNCTIONS/GENERIC/ni_combine_generic_sql_functions.bat - this will generate a file called ni_generic_functions.sql based on merging all generic functions from /FUNCTIONS/GENERIC/ folder
	
	merge all tables - /TABLES/ni_combine_tables_sql.bat - this will generate a file called ni_tables.sql based on merging all tables from /TABLES/ folder
	
	run all as one - execute_ni_combine_sql_files.bat
	
	once each of the .sql files has been created (), they can then each by executed on the chosen database. They must be executed in the following order:
	
		- ni_processing_functions.sql - PROCESSING FUNCTIONS
		
		- ni_trigger_functions.sql - TRIGGER FUNCTIONS
		
		- ni_tables.sql - TABLES
		
		- ni_generic_functions.sql - GENERIC (admin) FUNCTIONS
		
INSTALL VIA pg_restore

-- it is possible to install the database by restoring from the provided .backup file, using the pg_restore tool available within PostgreSQL

-- Open a command line window 
-- Open Windows Explorer / File System Explorer
-- Navigate to the bin folder of your PostgreSQL installation
-- Copy this path e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\9.0\bin
-- In the command line window, type CD, and then paste the bin folder path, and press Enter 
-- This will move the user in to the directory where the pg_restore.exe is located. It is this tool that will be used to restore the database schema, and effectively load the database schema in to your chosen destination database
-- Type the following restore command, adjusting values to your local environment, where specified:

pg_restore -U <insert_postgresql_username> -p <insert_postgresql_port_number> -h <insert_host_name> -d <insert_database_name> <insert_path_to_schema_backup>

pg_restore -U postgres -p 5432 -h localhost -d 'a_spatial_database' C:/SCHEMA/schema.backup

-- Press Enter when you have finished entering this information to install the database.
